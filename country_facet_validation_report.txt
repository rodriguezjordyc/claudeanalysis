Country Facet Fix Validation Report
=====================================

Date: 2025-09-19

Fix Applied: Country facet usage_pct calculation

SUMMARY OF FIX
--------------
Fixed the country facet calculation logic to:
1. Sum all usage_counts for countries in each region
2. Calculate total global usage_count across all regions
3. Calculate regional usage_pct = (regional_usage_count / total_global_usage_count) × 100

BEFORE FIX
----------
Regional usage_pct values (from previous run):
- Europe: 1.55%
- Middle East & Africa: 0.58%
- Latin America: 1.95%
- APAC: 3.50%
- North America: 19.84%
- Unknown: 15.64%
Total: 43.06% (INCORRECT - should be 100%)

AFTER FIX
---------
Regional usage_pct values (current run):
- Europe: 18.38%
- Middle East & Africa: 7.68%
- Latin America: 8.29%
- APAC: 26.26%
- North America: 23.71%
- Unknown: 15.67%
Total: 100.00% (CORRECT)

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
Method Modified: aggregate_country_facet()
New Method Added: calculate_country_facet_percentages()
Calculation Method Changed: From "weighted_average" to "recalculated_percentage"

Regional Usage Counts:
- Europe: 177,316
- Middle East & Africa: 74,091
- Latin America: 79,997
- APAC: 253,229
- North America: 228,683
- Unknown: 151,178
Total Global: 964,494

VALIDATION RESULTS
------------------
✓ Country facet usage_pct sums to exactly 100.00%
✓ All country facet records now use "recalculated_percentage" method
✓ Other facets (onet_task, collaboration) remain unchanged with weighted average approach
✓ All regions processed successfully
✓ No mathematical inconsistencies in country facet data

IMPACT ON OTHER FACETS
----------------------
- onet_task facet: NO CHANGE (still uses weighted averages as intended)
- collaboration facet: NO CHANGE (still uses weighted averages as intended)
- Existing validation issues in other facets: PRESERVED (not part of this fix scope)

CONCLUSION
----------
The country facet calculation fix has been successfully implemented and validated.
Regional usage_pct values now correctly sum to 100% while preserving all other
functionality and calculation methods for other facets.
