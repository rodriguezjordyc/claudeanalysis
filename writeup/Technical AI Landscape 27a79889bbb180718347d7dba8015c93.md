Software has become the primary engine of economic growth. While immediately true in digital environments, it's also become a critical part of physical systems: GPUs/CPUs, supply chains, agriculture, and health–making software developers essential to capturing economic value in the 21st century. The exponential growth of AI adoption and utilization are testimonies of this.
This means business and political leaders need to elevate the state of software development in their teams. The most efficient, impactful path to improving the state of software development is widespread, effective AI utilization among developers globally. Last week, however, Anthropic's [Economic Index Report](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report) showed us that effective AI integration is not as widespread or evenly distributed globally:

Anthropic's analysis shows varying levels of "AI maturity" across countries, suggesting individuals in wealthy countries are more likely to effectively integrate Claude (AI tools by proxy) into their workflows than individuals in less wealthy countries. This insight, alongside the publication of the underlying data, drove me to dig into the numbers myself and zoom in on regional variations (specifically around software development tasks) across human-AI collaboration, request complexity, and usage efficiency—painting a picture of how technical AI integration differs across regions globally.

## Approach

Anthropic’s data is strongly positioned to analyze the state of software development, because the time period the dataset covers is the period when Claude was the preferred AI platform for coding—which has recently shifted towards GPT-5. The dataset offers insight into country-level variations across request types by complexity levels, collaboration patterns, and usage for occupational tasks. At the global level, the API data shares indices on the prompt and completion length for various tasks, alongside cost indices to execute those tasks.
The goal of this analysis is to provide directional insights into the regional variance of technical AI adoption, so my work aggregates Anthropic's country-level data into 5 regions: APAC, Europe, Latin America, Middle East & Africa, and North America. The data informed three complementary regional analyses:

- **Request Complexity**: Distribution of software development requests by complexity levels across regions (how complex are the technical tasks users assign in each region?)
- **Human-AI Collaboration Patterns**: Distribution of regional tasks that automate versus augment work (do users in each region primarily use Claude to augment their capabilities or automate their tasks?)
- **Token Efficiency Measurement**: Regional prompt, task completion, and cost token indices for software development tasks (how much computational sophistication does each region actually deploy when using AI for technical tasks?)

This analysis reveals patterns in AI adoption across regions, enabling a combined metric that captures both task sophistication and interaction quality—a Technical AI Maturity Score. You can review the methodology and work on [Github](https://github.com/rodriguezjordyc/claudeanalysis).

Why does this Technical AI Maturity Score  matter? Because software development drives economic growth—both for entire countries and individual people. Individuals are using Replit, Vercel, and Lovable to build businesses that make real money. Development teams are shipping products faster than ever with support from agentic ecosystems like Cursor, Factory, and Codex.

There are, of course, limitations in the data and methodology, as well as economic and social factors that influence regional outcomes (see Appendix A). Anthropic’s report shares an objective view of AI diffusion globally but abstains from filling in the blanks on implications. These results hopefully catalyze conversations that fills in those blanks.

Understanding how well different regions use AI for coding tells us who's best positioned to capture the economic benefits AI creates. The AI Maturity Score isn't perfect—there's way more to the story—but it gives us a starting point to understand regional positioning. 

## Results

### Human-AI Collaboration

The collaboration data shows some clear regional differences in how people work with AI:

![automation-augmentation-analysis.png](Technical%20AI%20Landscape%2027a79889bbb180718347d7dba8015c93/automation-augmentation-analysis.png)

- Latin America and Middle East & Africa show a preference for automation-leaning collaboration styles (directive + feedback loop)
- North America, Europe, and APAC show a preference for augmentation-leaning collaboration styles (task iteration + learning + validation)

### Request Complexity

Request complexity data shows big differences in the kinds of problems developers solve with AI:

![complexityanalysis.png](Technical%20AI%20Landscape%2027a79889bbb180718347d7dba8015c93/complexityanalysis.png)

- North America and APAC use AI for high complexity technical tasks the most
- Europe, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa use AI for low complexity technical tasks the most

Additionally, mapping technical requests to different stages of the software development lifecycle, APAC and Middle East & Africa rely more heavily on AI during the testing and QA stages, whereas Europe, Latin America, and North America rely more heavily on AI during the implementation and coding stages

### Token Efficiency

Token and cost indices data shows us who's efficiently managing usage costs:

![tokenefficiencyanalysis.png](Technical%20AI%20Landscape%2027a79889bbb180718347d7dba8015c93/tokenefficiencyanalysis.png)

- Latin America and Middle East & Africa's token index when prompting technical tasks is higher than other regions' token indices
- Latin America and Middle East & Africa's token index for the completion of technical tasks is also higher than other regions' token indices
- Latin America and Middle East & Africa's cost index for technical tasks is higher than other regions' cost index

### Technical AI Maturity Score

The Technical AI Maturity Score combines all three factors into one ranking:

![technicalmaturityscore.png](Technical%20AI%20Landscape%2027a79889bbb180718347d7dba8015c93/technicalmaturityscore.png)

- North America leads in technical AI maturity, followed by Europe and APAC
- Latin America and Middle East & Africa rank the lowest in technical AI maturity

This metric rewards regions that use AI to augment developers (not their tasks), tackle hard problems, and do it efficiently—giving us a better picture than each component independently.

## Three Dimensions of Technical AI Integration

The analysis focuses on understanding *how* regions use AI for coding, less on *how much* they use it. This uncovered three distinct patterns across regions: how they collaborate with AI, what complexity problems they tackle, and how efficiently they use resources.

### Collaboration Philosophy

| **Automation-Seeking** | **Augmentation-seeking** |
| --- | --- |
| AI as an advanced tool | AI as a thinking partner |
| Directive + Feedback patterns | Iteration + Learning + Validation patterns |

*Implication*: Augmentation scales human capability exponentially; automation replaces effort linearly

### Complexity Engagement

| **Complexity-avoidant** | **Complexity-embracing** |
| --- | --- |
| High usage of AI for simple tasks | High usage of AI for complex tasks |
| Level 2 tasks | Level 0 tasks |

*Implication*: Complex technical work generates disproportionately higher economic value

### Resource Efficiency

| **Token-intensive** | **Token-efficient** |
| --- | --- |
| Higher prompt, completion, cost indices | Lower prompt, completion, cost indices |
| Higher costs | Efficient resource utilization |

*Implication*: Efficiency determines scalability and sustainable competitive advantage

## Regional AI Maturity Archetypes

Evaluating regions across these dimensions creates three clear profiles: sophistication leaders, balanced adopters, and automation seekers.

|  | Collaboration | Efficiency | Complexity | Regions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sophistication Leaders** | High Augmentation | High | High | North America |
| **Balanced Adopters** | Moderate Augmentation | Variable | Moderate | Europe, APAC |
| **Automation Seekers** | High Automation | Low | Low | Latin America, Middle East & Africa |

Sophistication Leaders are leveraging AI as a strategic partner to solve complex technical problems, building advantages that are difficult to replicate for other regions. Balanced Adopters are creating steady value but have a lot of room to grow. Automation seekers are focused on automating simple tasks at high costs, risking pigeonholing developers into low leverage tasks.

## Strategic Growth Opportunities

Regional profiles intend to draw different paths towards economic success in an increasingly AI-native world. The significance of these patterns depends on your role in the ecosystem, but they show clear risks and opportunities for anyone who wants AI's benefits distributed globally.

### Mature Regions: APAC, Europe, North America

| Risk | Sophistication plateau as technical AI adoption expands (which can also be a positive signal) |
| --- | --- |
| Opportunity | Lead next-gen AI-native development methodologies |
| Strategic Focus | Pioneer Human-AI collaboration standards, export expertise |

### Emerging Regions: Latin America, Middle East & Africa

| Risk | Efficiency gap may compound into permanent economic disadvantage |
| --- | --- |
| Opportunity | Leapfrog traditional adoption curves with sophistication-first strategies |
| Strategic Focus | Targeted complexity complexity engagement training |

### For AI Companies

*Go-to-market*

The regional archetypes suggest AI companies face fundamentally different growth challenges than traditional SaaS. Sophistication Leaders like North America reward premium positioning around complex collaboration, while Automation Seekers in Latin America and MEA may require educational investment before monetization. Companies winning in mature markets through PLG or cracked sales organizations doesn't guarantee similar traction in emerging regions without adapting to local complexity preferences and efficiency constraints—traditional playbooks break down when users seek automation over augmentation.

*Cultural Connection*

SDLC task distribution reveals deeper cultural differences than language localization. APAC's testing/QA focus, for example, suggests AI companies need region-specific feature prioritization, not just translation. The collaboration patterns also indicate that community engagement strategies successful in augmentation-seeking regions may alienate automation-seeking users. Growth velocity depends on understanding these cultural collaboration preferences rather than assuming universal developer needs.

*Strategic Positioning*

The efficiency gap in emerging regions creates both risk and opportunity for AI startups. Companies that help Automation Seekers transition to complexity-embracing behaviors could develop strong, local partnerships, but those reinforcing the "automation trap" risk limiting long-term market potential. There is a tradeoff optimizing for viral adoption in emerging regions or investing in elevating regional AI maturity—a strategic choice that determines sustainable competitive advantage versus short-term growth.
